Week: 2, Lesson 1
Lesson: Balancing planning and coding

---

## What You’ll Learn

- **Why planning matters:** Understand how a short plan – even just five lines of comments – helps prevent mistakes and wasted effort.

- **Rapid code feedback:** When it’s OK to jump straight into coding for quick experiments, like testing a print statement or simple behavior.

- **Risks of skipping planning:** See how missing a plan leads to lost features, harder maintenance, or confusion on requirements.

- **Micro-plan technique:** Use small cycles of plan, code, and test to work more efficiently.

- **Switching strategies:** Learn to choose between planning-heavy and code-heavy approaches depending on task size and risk.

---

## Core Ideas

- **Small plans save time:** Even a few bullet points before coding guard against common errors.

- **Code to learn, plan to build:** Instant coding works well for tiny tests; planning shines for larger functions or teamwork.

- **Repeatable structure:** Planning first makes code easier to extend, debug, and share.

- **Dynamic workflow:** Cycle between planning and coding instead of sticking rigidly to one or the other.

## Reference Snippet

Here’s how a micro-plan looks as code comments before coding:

```plaintext
python
```

`# Plan: # 1. Define greet function # 2. Repeat print 3 times # 3. Use for loop for repetition # 4. Test function by calling greet() # 5. Confirm output prints "Hello Marco!" three times  def greet():     for i in range(3):         print("Hello Marco!")  greet() `

If you skip the loop, manual repetition works too:

```plaintext
python
```

`def greet():     print("Hello Marco!")     print("Hello Marco!")     print("Hello Marco!")  greet() `

## Common Pitfalls

- **Name confusion:** Using the same word as both a variable and function name can break code.

- **Syntax errors:** Forgetting colons or indentation causes Python to throw errors.

- **Unplanned complexity:** Jumping into code for bigger problems leads to confusion, missing requirements, or hard-to-maintain code.

- **Forgetting to run tests:** Planning and coding means nothing if you don’t check your result.

---

## Quick Practice

- Write a function that prints “Balancing planning and coding is key!” three times, *without* using a loop.
   *Extra:* Edit one print line to a different phrase, run, and see your output change.

- Reflect: When did planning help you avoid a coding mistake in this week’s lesson?

## Why Good Planning Matters

- Even a tiny plan gives you structure and direction.

- Switching between planning and coding lets you troubleshoot faster and reach working code more reliably.

- As projects get larger, planning helps you avoid missing features and future headaches.
