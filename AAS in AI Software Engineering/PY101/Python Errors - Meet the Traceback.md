# Python Errors: Meet the Traceback

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Course:** PY101 - Introduction to Python

## What is a Traceback?

A **traceback** is Python's detailed error report that appears when your code crashes. Think of it as a GPS navigation system showing you the exact route that led to the accident.

The traceback "traces back" through your code's execution path, showing every function call that led to the error, where it happened, and what went wrong.

**Why Tracebacks Matter:**  
Learning to read tracebacks turns cryptic error messages into precise debugging instructions. Once you understand them, errors become helpful guides rather than frustrating obstacles.

---

## How to Read a Traceback

**Golden Rule: Always read from bottom to top.**

Python prints tracebacks with the most recent information at the bottom, so start there and work your way up.

### The Three Key Components

**1. The Error Line (Bottom) - "What Went Wrong"**  
The last line tells you the error type and a specific message about what failed.

```python
NameError: name 'message' is not defined
```

This line answers: "What kind of error is this, and why did it happen?"

**2. The Stack Trace (Middle) - "The Path to the Error"**  
These lines show the sequence of function calls that led to the error. Each line represents one step in the execution path.

```python
File "main.py", line 7, in a
  b()
File "main.py", line 10, in b
  print(message)
```

This section answers: "How did I get to the error? What function called what?"

**3. The Code Snippet - "The Exact Problem Spot"**  
The traceback shows the actual line of code that crashed, often with a caret (^) pointing to the problem.

```python
  print(message)
        ^^^^^^^
```

This pinpoints: "This is the exact code that failed."

### Reading a Complete Traceback

Let's read a real traceback from bottom to top:

```python
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 12, in <module>
    a()
  File "main.py", line 7, in a
    b()
  File "main.py", line 10, in b
    print(message)
NameError: name 'message' is not defined
```

**Reading Process:**

1. **Start at bottom:** `NameError: name 'message' is not defined` - I tried to use a variable called `message` that doesn't exist
2. **Look at the last code:** `print(message)` in function `b()` at line 10 - This is where the error occurred
3. **Trace backwards:** `b()` was called from function `a()` at line 7
4. **Continue tracing:** `a()` was called from the main program at line 12
5. **Understand the path:** Main program → `a()` → `b()` → Error

## Two Categories of Errors

Python errors fall into two main categories based on when they occur:

### Category 1: Parse-Time Errors (Before Running)

These errors occur before your code even starts executing. Python's parser reads your file and says "I don't understand this syntax."

**Characteristics:**
- Happen during the parsing phase
- No traceback is generated (Python can't run the code at all)
- Must be fixed before the program can run
- Usually caused by typos or formatting mistakes

**Types:**

#### SyntaxError

A violation of Python's grammar rules - like writing a sentence without proper punctuation.

```python
# Bad: Missing closing parenthesis
print("Hello"

# Error message:
# SyntaxError: '(' was never closed
```

```python
# Bad: Invalid Python syntax
if x = 5:  # Should use == for comparison, not =
    print("Equal")

# Error message:
# SyntaxError: invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?
```

```python
# Fixed:
print("Hello")

if x == 5:
    print("Equal")
```

#### IndentationError

Incorrect spacing that confuses Python's block structure. Python uses indentation to determine which code belongs to which block.

```python
# Bad: No indentation
def my_func():
print("This should be indented")
    
# Error message:
# IndentationError: expected an indented block after function definition
```

```python
# Bad: Inconsistent indentation
def my_func():
    print("4 spaces")
      print("6 spaces")  # Inconsistent!
    
# Error message:
# IndentationError: unexpected indent
```

```python
# Fixed:
def my_func():
    print("Consistent 4 spaces")
    print("Consistent 4 spaces")
```

**Pro Tip:** Configure your code editor to show whitespace characters. This makes indentation errors visible before you run the code.

---

### Category 2: Runtime Errors (While Running)

These errors occur after Python successfully parses your file. The syntax is correct, but the code tries to do something impossible during execution.

**Characteristics:**
- Happen while the program is running
- Generate a full traceback
- The syntax is valid, but the operation fails
- Often depend on specific values or conditions

---

## Common Runtime Errors: Deep Dive

### NameError

**What It Means:**  
You tried to use a variable or function name that Python doesn't recognize in the current scope.

**Common Causes:**
- Typo in the variable name
- Using a variable before defining it
- Trying to access a variable outside its scope

**Example 1: Using Before Defining**

```python
# Bad: Variable used before definition
def shout():
    print(message)  # message doesn't exist yet!

shout()
message = "hi"  # Defined too late

# Traceback:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "main.py", line 4, in <module>
#     shout()
#   File "main.py", line 2, in shout
#     print(message)
# NameError: name 'message' is not defined
```

**Reading This Traceback:**
1. Bottom: `NameError: name 'message' is not defined` - The variable doesn't exist
2. Middle: Error in `shout()` at line 2, called from main at line 4
3. Understanding: When `shout()` runs at line 4, `message` hasn't been created yet (line 5)

```python
# Fixed: Define before use
def shout():
    print(message)  # Now message exists

message = "hi"  # Defined first
shout()

# Output: hi
```

**Example 2: Typo in Name**

```python
# Bad: Typo in variable name
user_name = "Marco"
print(username)  # Should be user_name (with underscore)

# NameError: name 'username' is not defined
```

```python
# Fixed:
user_name = "Marco"
print(user_name)

# Output: Marco
```

---

### ZeroDivisionError

**What It Means:**  
You attempted to divide a number by zero, which is mathematically undefined.

**Common Causes:**
- Using user input without validation
- Calculating averages with zero items
- Loop counters that reach zero unexpectedly

**Example: The Classic Division Bug**

```python
# Bad: No zero check
def calculate_average(total_score, num_students):
    return total_score / num_students  # Crashes if num_students is 0

print(calculate_average(100, 0))

# Traceback:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "main.py", line 4, in <module>
#     print(calculate_average(100, 0))
#   File "main.py", line 2, in calculate_average
#     return total_score / num_students
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

```python
# Fixed: Add validation
def calculate_average(total_score, num_students):
    if num_students == 0:
        return "Cannot calculate average: no students."
    return total_score / num_students

print(calculate_average(100, 0))
# Output: Cannot calculate average: no students.

print(calculate_average(100, 5))
# Output: 20.0
```

**Real-World Example: Grade Calculator**

```python
# Bad: Doesn't handle empty grade list
def calculate_gpa(grades):
    total = sum(grades)
    return total / len(grades)  # Crashes if grades is empty list

print(calculate_gpa([]))  # ZeroDivisionError!
```

```python
# Fixed: Validate input
def calculate_gpa(grades):
    if len(grades) == 0:
        return "No grades to calculate"
    
    total = sum(grades)
    return total / len(grades)

print(calculate_gpa([]))       # Output: No grades to calculate
print(calculate_gpa([3.5, 4.0, 3.7]))  # Output: 3.7333...
```

---

### TypeError

**What It Means:**  
You tried to perform an operation on a data type that doesn't support that operation.

**Common Causes:**
- Mixing incompatible types (string + integer)
- Using `input()` without converting to the right type
- Calling something that isn't a function

**Example 1: Mixing Types**

```python
# Bad: Adding string and integer
user_age = input("How old are you? ")  # input() always returns a string
# User types: 25
# user_age is now "25" (string), not 25 (integer)

print(user_age + 10)  # Trying to do "25" + 10

# Traceback:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "main.py", line 5, in <module>
#     print(user_age + 10)
# TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
```

**Understanding the Error:**  
Python is saying: "You're trying to add a string and an integer together. I can add string + string, or integer + integer, but not string + integer."

```python
# Fixed: Convert string to integer
user_age_str = input("How old are you? ")
user_age_int = int(user_age_str)  # Convert to integer

print(user_age_int + 10)
# Input: 25
# Output: 35
```

**Example 2: String Multiplication Restrictions**

```python
# Bad: Multiplying string by float
price = 12.0
banner = "*" * price  # Can't multiply string by float

# TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'
```

```python
# Fixed: Convert float to integer
price = 12.0
banner = "*" * int(price)

print(banner)
# Output: ************
```

**Example 3: Wrong Type for Operation**

```python
# Bad: Trying to call a non-function
message = "Hello"
message()  # message is a string, not a function

# TypeError: 'str' object is not callable
```

```python
# Fixed: Use the string correctly
message = "Hello"
print(message)

# Output: Hello
```

## Defensive Coding: Using Return to Prevent Errors

The `return` statement has a powerful property: it **immediately exits the function**. You can use this to create "guard clauses" that prevent dangerous code from executing.

**Key Concept:**  
Code after a `return` statement is "unreachable code" - Python never executes it because the function has already exited.

### Example: Preventing Division by Zero

**Broken Code:**

```python
def a():
    b()  # Calls function b

def b():
    print(3 / 0)  # This crashes immediately
    return "can't divide"  # Never reached

a()

# Traceback:
# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "main.py", line 8, in <module>
#     a()
#   File "main.py", line 2, in a
#     b()
#   File "main.py", line 5, in b
#     print(3 / 0)
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

**Fixed Code:**

```python
def a():
    print(b())  # Now prints what b() returns

def b():
    return "can't divide"  # Exit immediately with this value
    
    # Everything below this line is unreachable
    print(3 / 0)  # This line is SKIPPED

a()

# Output: can't divide
```

**Execution Flow:**

1. **Line 8:** Program starts, calls `a()`
2. **Line 2:** Inside `a()`, encounters `print(b())` - must call `b()` to get its return value
3. **Line 5:** Python enters `b()`, immediately sees `return "can't divide"`
4. **Exit:** Python stops executing `b()`, grabs the string, and leaves the function
5. **Line 6:** Never executed - it's unreachable code
6. **Back to Line 2:** The string `"can't divide"` is returned to where `b()` was called
7. **Print:** `print()` receives the string and displays it

**Visualization:**

```
Call Stack Timeline:
─────────────────────────
a() called
├─ print(b()) encountered
│  └─ b() called
│     ├─ return executed ← Function exits here
│     └─ [Line 6 never runs]
├─ "can't divide" returned
└─ print() displays it

Result: "can't divide"
```

### Practical Application: Input Validation

```python
def process_grade(score):
    # Guard clause: Exit early if input is invalid
    if score < 0 or score > 100:
        return "Invalid score"
    
    # Safe to proceed - we know score is 0-100
    if score >= 90:
        return "A"
    elif score >= 80:
        return "B"
    elif score >= 70:
        return "C"
    elif score >= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

print(process_grade(95))   # Output: A
print(process_grade(150))  # Output: Invalid score
print(process_grade(-5))   # Output: Invalid score
```

**Why This Works:**  
The guard clause at the top checks for invalid input. If found, it returns immediately and all the grade calculation code below is skipped. This prevents errors from invalid data.

## Understanding the Call Stack

The **call stack** is Python's system for tracking which functions are currently running and in what order they were called.

**Metaphor: Stack of Plates**  
Imagine washing dishes. You stack clean plates one on top of another. The last plate you put on the stack is the first one you'll take off.

**How It Works:**

1. When you call a function, Python "pushes" it onto the stack
2. When a function calls another function, that new function goes on top
3. The function at the top of the stack is currently executing
4. When a function finishes, Python "pops" it off the stack
5. Execution continues in the function that's now on top

### Visualizing the Stack

```python
def first():
    print("Starting first")
    second()
    print("Back in first")

def second():
    print("Starting second")
    third()
    print("Back in second")

def third():
    print("In third")

first()
```

**Stack Timeline:**

```
Step 1: first() called
Stack: [first]
Output: "Starting first"

Step 2: second() called from first
Stack: [first, second]
Output: "Starting second"

Step 3: third() called from second
Stack: [first, second, third]
Output: "In third"

Step 4: third() finishes
Stack: [first, second]
Output: "Back in second"

Step 5: second() finishes
Stack: [first]
Output: "Back in first"

Step 6: first() finishes
Stack: []
Program ends
```

### Reading Stack in Tracebacks

When an error occurs, the traceback shows the call stack at the moment of the crash:

```python
def main():
    calculate()

def calculate():
    process_data()

def process_data():
    result = 10 / 0  # Error!

main()

# Traceback (most recent call last):
#   File "main.py", line 10, in <module>
#     main()
#   File "main.py", line 2, in main
#     calculate()
#   File "main.py", line 5, in calculate
#     process_data()
#   File "main.py", line 8, in process_data
#     result = 10 / 0
# ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
```

**Reading This Stack:**
- **Bottom (error):** Division by zero in `process_data()` at line 8
- **Above:** `process_data()` was called from `calculate()` at line 5
- **Above:** `calculate()` was called from `main()` at line 2
- **Top:** `main()` was called from the main program at line 10

**The Path:** Main program → `main()` → `calculate()` → `process_data()` → **ERROR**

This is the **"most recent call last"** principle - the traceback shows the journey from the program's start to where it crashed.

---

## Error Handling Strategies

### 1. Prevention (Best Approach)

Write code that avoids errors by validating inputs and checking conditions.

```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    # Prevent ZeroDivisionError
    if b == 0:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"
    return a / b
```

### 2. Guard Clauses

Use early returns to exit functions before dangerous code executes.

```python
def calculate_discount(price, discount_rate):
    # Guard: Check for negative values
    if price < 0 or discount_rate < 0:
        return "Invalid input"
    
    # Guard: Check for impossible discount
    if discount_rate > 1:
        return "Discount cannot exceed 100%"
    
    # Safe to calculate
    return price * (1 - discount_rate)
```

### 3. Type Conversion with Validation

Always convert and validate user input.

```python
def get_age():
    age_str = input("Enter your age: ")
    
    # Check if input is numeric before converting
    if not age_str.isdigit():
        return "Please enter a number"
    
    age = int(age_str)
    
    # Validate reasonable age range
    if age < 0 or age > 120:
        return "Please enter a valid age"
    
    return age
```

### 4. Debugging with Print Statements

When you get a traceback, add print statements to see values before the error.

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    print("Input numbers:", numbers)  # Debug
    print("Length:", len(numbers))    # Debug
    
    if len(numbers) == 0:
        return "Empty list"
    
    total = sum(numbers)
    print("Total:", total)  # Debug
    
    average = total / len(numbers)
    print("Average:", average)  # Debug
    
    return average
```

## Common Error Patterns and Solutions

### Pattern 1: "I defined the variable, why doesn't it work?"

```python
# Problem: Order matters
def greet():
    print(name)  # name doesn't exist yet

greet()
name = "Marco"  # Defined after use
```

**Solution:** Define before use

```python
name = "Marco"  # Define first

def greet():
    print(name)  # Now it exists

greet()
```

### Pattern 2: "The math looks right, why does it crash?"

```python
# Problem: Hidden zero in calculation
def calculate_ratio(wins, losses):
    return wins / losses  # Crashes if losses = 0

calculate_ratio(10, 0)
```

**Solution:** Validate before calculating

```python
def calculate_ratio(wins, losses):
    if losses == 0:
        return "Cannot calculate ratio with zero losses"
    return wins / losses
```

### Pattern 3: "Input looks like a number, why can't I use it?"

```python
# Problem: input() returns strings
age = input("Age: ")  # User enters 25, but age is "25"
next_year = age + 1   # "25" + 1 causes TypeError
```

**Solution:** Convert string to number

```python
age_str = input("Age: ")
age = int(age_str)    # Convert to integer
next_year = age + 1   # Now it works
```

---

## Practice: Debug These Errors

Try to predict the error before running the code:

**Exercise 1:**
```python
def calculate_total(prices):
    return sum(prices) / len(prices)

calculate_total([])
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Error:** `ZeroDivisionError: division by zero`

**Why:** Empty list has length 0, causing division by zero

**Fix:**
```python
def calculate_total(prices):
    if len(prices) == 0:
        return 0
    return sum(prices) / len(prices)
```
</details>

**Exercise 2:**
```python
def welcome_user():
    print(f"Welcome, {user}!")

welcome_user()
user = "Marco"
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Error:** `NameError: name 'user' is not defined`

**Why:** `user` is used before it's defined

**Fix:**
```python
user = "Marco"  # Define first

def welcome_user():
    print(f"Welcome, {user}!")

welcome_user()
```
</details>

**Exercise 3:**
```python
score = input("Enter score: ")
final_score = score * 1.1
print(final_score)
```

<details>
<summary>Solution</summary>

**Error:** `TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'float'`

**Why:** `input()` returns a string, can't multiply string by 1.1

**Fix:**
```python
score_str = input("Enter score: ")
score = float(score_str)  # Convert to number
final_score = score * 1.1
print(final_score)
```
</details>

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Read tracebacks bottom-to-top** - Error type and message first, then trace the path  
✅ **Two error categories** - Parse-time (before running) vs Runtime (while running)  
✅ **NameError** - Using undefined variables or typos in names  
✅ **ZeroDivisionError** - Always validate before dividing  
✅ **TypeError** - Check types, especially with `input()`  
✅ **Return exits immediately** - Use guard clauses to prevent errors  
✅ **Call stack shows the path** - How you got from start to error  
✅ **Prevention beats fixing** - Validate inputs and check conditions early

**Remember:** Errors are not failures, they're precise feedback. Learning to read and understand tracebacks transforms debugging from frustration into systematic problem-solving.

## Quick Reference: Error Checklist

When you get an error, ask yourself:

- [ ] What is the error type? (Last line of traceback)
- [ ] Where did it occur? (File, line number, function)
- [ ] What was I trying to do? (The operation that failed)
- [ ] What values were involved? (Add print statements)
- [ ] Did I define before using? (NameError)
- [ ] Am I dividing by zero? (ZeroDivisionError)
- [ ] Are my types compatible? (TypeError)
- [ ] Is my indentation correct? (IndentationError)
- [ ] Can I add a guard clause to prevent this?
