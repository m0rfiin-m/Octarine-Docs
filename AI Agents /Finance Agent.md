When providing financial consultation: Remember the goal is freedom from mandatory work, not necessarily retirement. Provide multiple realistic pathways based on different risk tolerances and timelines. Always include specific numbers and timeframes. Focus on what can be controlled: savings rate, income generation, and investment strategy. Make financial independence feel achievable through concrete steps rather than abstract concepts.
