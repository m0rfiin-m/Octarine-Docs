- Campaign setup, monitoring, reporting
- Coordinate timelines and deliverables

**Key Preparation Points:**

**Strengths to Emphasize:**
1. Remote coordination from Tanbii (community campaigns, content calendars, team coordination)
2. Administrative operations from Sports Media Inc (scheduling, registrations, research)
3. Gaming culture understanding (16,000-member Discord community)
4. Data analysis capabilities (business analysis certification)
5. Dual degree advantage (Entertainment Business + CS/AI)

**Experience Positioning:**
- **Tanbii:** Hands-on project management, lifecycle campaign delivery
- **Sports Media Inc:** Remote administrative support, research, coordination (NOT production-heavy)

"My esports experience has been more operational and community-focused rather than production. At Sports Media Inc, I handled administrative coordination remotely. At Tanbii, I was hands-on managing a 16,000-member gaming community daily. What I bring is a strong foundation in gaming culture, remote coordination skills, and administrative rigor. What I'm excited to learn at Livewire is the brand campaign side - translating gaming audience insights into effective client strategies."

## Learning & Development

### Communication Skills

**Video: "Why Nobody Listens To You (and how to fix it)" by Vinh Giang**

**Nine Core Lessons:**

**1. The 30-30-30-10 Formula**
- 30% Education (solid content)
- 30% Entertainment (you ARE an entertainer)
- 30% Inspiration (energy transfer through voice)
- 10% X Factor (your unique traits)

**2. Virtual Communication Mastery**
- Eye contact with camera, not yourself
- Amp up energy 50-70% on camera (natural drop in virtual settings)
- Position camera back to show hand gestures
- Use space dynamically

**3. Play With Your Voice**
- Vary: volume, melody, pitch, emotion, pauses
- Don't just use voice - play with it
- Most avoid this because they fear judgment
- Makes you infinitely more engaging

**4. Let Go of Perfection**
- Goal: Add value, not be perfect
- Audience doesn't have your notes
- Don't make big deal of errors
- Theater rule: If you don't react to mistakes, they won't either

**5. Exposure Therapy**
- You're nervous because you rarely do the thing
- Solution: Do it way more often
- Practice with low-stakes situations (greet strangers, give compliments)
- Repeated exposure decreases anxiety

**6. Be as Big as the Room**
- Adjust energy to audience size
- One person: dial down
- 10-20 people: perfect for camera
- 10,000 people: amp way up
- Most people are too loud or too quiet for their room

**7. Managing Pre-Speech Nerves**
- Wim Hof breathing (12-15 minutes) - calms mind/body
- Jumping jacks - burns excess adrenaline
- Orchestral war music - mood hack
- Funny videos - endorphins boost

**8. Building Rapport With High-Status People**
- Humanize them (they're just people)
- Use storytelling to become memorable
- Don't list features, tell stories

**9. All the World's a Stage**
- You play different roles (father, husband, teacher, professional)
- Improve communication to elevate every role
- Use skills to spread love, kindness, compassion

**Key Philosophy:**
- Be playful, reconnect with inner child
- People are naturally drawn to those who play with communication
- Don't just deliver information - perform it
