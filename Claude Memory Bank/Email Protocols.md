## Core Email Writing Principles

### When Drafting Professional Emails

**Structure Requirements:**
1. Clear subject line with purpose or position name
2. "Hi [Name]" or "Dear [Team]" opening
3. Direct first sentence stating purpose
4. One paragraph per key point
5. Action item or availability statement
6. "Best regards," with full name
7. Contact info when appropriate

**Style Requirements:**
1. Active voice, declarative sentences
2. Proper grammar and capitalization
3. Bullet points for qualifications or lists
4. Connect experience directly to their needs
5. Zero filler words
6. Professional but not stiff

**Tone Requirements:**
1. Confident without arrogance
2. Polite markers where natural
3. Every sentence serves a function
4. Genuine enthusiasm for opportunity

## Banned Corporate Language

### Never Use These Phrases

**Communication Jargon:**
- "Circle back"
- "Touch base"
- "Ping me"
- "Loop in"
- "Synergize"
- "Take this offline"
- "Put a pin in that"

**Business Buzzwords:**
- "Move the needle"
- "Boil the ocean"
- "Low-hanging fruit"
- "Paradigm shift"
- "Best practices" (use sparingly, prefer specific terms)
- "Leverage" (as a verb, use "use" instead)
- "Bandwidth" (meaning time/capacity)

**Filler Language:**
- "At the end of the day"
- "Going forward"
- "For all intents and purposes"
- "It is what it is"
- "Think outside the box"
- "Win-win situation"

**Why:** These phrases sound fake, corporate, and disconnected from natural human conversation. Marco's style is professional but personable.

## Email Length Guidelines

### Default Approach

**Standard Email:** 3-5 sentences maximum
- State purpose
- Provide necessary context (1-2 sentences)
- Action item or availability
- Sign-off

**Only Go Longer When:**
- Job application or cover letter
- Complex situation requiring detail
- Multiple points must be addressed
- First introduction requiring context

### The "Get to the Point" Test

**Before sending, ask:**
- Can any sentence be removed?
- Is there any filler content?
- Does every paragraph serve a distinct purpose?
- Could this be clearer with fewer words?

**If yes to any of these, cut it down further.**

---

## Greeting Standards

### Default Greetings

**First Email to Someone:**
- "Hi [Name]," (preferred)
- "Dear [Name]," (if very formal situation)
- Never skip the greeting on first contact

**Follow-Up Emails:**
- Skip greeting, just respond directly
- Exception: If significant time has passed, use "Hi [Name]" again

**Multiple People:**
- "Hi everyone,"
- "Hi team,"
- "Hi [Name] and [Name],"

**Never Use:**
- "Dear" unless extremely formal situation
- "Hey" in professional contexts
- "Greetings" (too formal/stiff)
- "To Whom It May Concern" (find a name)

---

## Critical Rule: No Credential Front-Loading

### The Problem

**Don't Do This:**
"As a recent graduate with a Bachelor's in Esports Management from Harrisburg University and currently pursuing my Master's in Entertainment Business at Full Sail University, with experience managing a 15,000-member Discord community and conducting market research at Sports Media Inc..."

**Why It's Wrong:**
- Sounds like resume dumping
- Unnatural conversation flow
- Forces qualifications into every email
- Assumes recipient needs convincing immediately
- Breaks natural relationship building

### The Right Approach

**Let Conversations Reveal Qualifications Naturally:**
- Trust that interested people will ask follow-up questions
- Provide context when directly relevant to the conversation
- Let your expertise show through your communication quality
- Save credentials for formal applications where expected

**Exceptions (When Credentials Are Appropriate):**
- Cold outreach where recipient doesn't know you
- Job applications and cover letters
- Professional bio or introduction requests
- When someone specifically asks about your background
- Networking events or formal introductions

**Example of Natural Flow:**

❌ **Bad:**
"Hi [Name], As a Master's student studying Entertainment Business with prior experience in community management and esports operations, I wanted to reach out about the opportunity to discuss..."

✅ **Good:**
"Hi [Name], I saw your post about gaming marketing strategies and wanted to connect. I've been working in gaming community management and would love to hear your perspective on..."

## Tone Calibration Guide

### Professional But Personable

**What This Means:**
- Write like talking to a respected colleague
- Formal enough for business context
- Human enough to build rapport
- Natural language flow

**Achieve This By:**
- Using contractions occasionally (I'm, you're, we're)
- Varying sentence length
- Showing genuine interest and enthusiasm
- Being direct without being cold

**Examples:**

❌ **Too Formal (Stiff):**
"I am writing to formally express my sincere interest in pursuing the aforementioned opportunity to contribute my professional expertise to your esteemed organization."

❌ **Too Casual (Unprofessional):**
"Hey! Saw your job post and totally think I'd be awesome at this. Hit me up if you want to chat!"

✅ **Professional But Personable (Just Right):**
"I'm excited about the Account Coordinator role at Livewire. My experience managing gaming communities and coordinating campaigns aligns well with what you're looking for, and I'd love to discuss how I can contribute."
