### Honest Experience Positioning

### Common Interview Questions & Answers

**"Tell me about yourself"**

"I recently completed my Bachelor's in Esports Management from Harrisburg University and I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Entertainment Business at Full Sail. Over the past year, I've been working in esports operations and community management, most recently managing a 16,000-member Discord community at Tanbii where I increased engagement by 35% through strategic campaigns and content.

What draws me to this Account Coordinator role at Livewire is the opportunity to apply my gaming industry knowledge and operational coordination skills to brand campaigns. I'm excited about translating my understanding of gaming audiences into effective marketing strategies, and I'm particularly interested in learning from experienced Account Managers how to deliver successful campaigns in this fast-paced industry."

**"Why Livewire?"**

"Three main reasons: First, Livewire is positioned at the exact intersection of my experience and interests - gaming, marketing, and data-driven strategy. Second, the company's growth trajectory and proprietary technology show you're not just executing campaigns, you're innovating in gaming marketing. Third, the Account Coordinator role offers the perfect opportunity to contribute my operational skills while learning campaign management from the ground up in a supportive structure."

**"What's your biggest weakness?"**

"I'd say my biggest area for growth is the brand campaign side of gaming marketing. I have strong operational and community management experience, but I'm still building my expertise in how brands effectively connect with gaming audiences through integrated campaigns. That's exactly why I'm drawn to the Account Coordinator role - I want to learn from experienced Account Managers and develop that strategic campaign thinking while contributing the coordination and gaming culture skills I already have."

**"Where do you see yourself in 5 years?"**

"In five years, I see myself as an Account Manager running gaming marketing campaigns independently, having built strong relationships with both clients and gaming publishers. I want to be someone who deeply understands both the business strategy side and the gaming culture side - that intersection where effective campaigns live. I'm also interested in how AI and technology will continue to transform gaming marketing, given my CS background, so I'd love to be at the forefront of those innovations."

**"Tell me about a time you handled a difficult situation"**

Use STAR example about managing community conflicts at Tanbii or handling crisis calls at Optum.

**"How do you prioritize when managing multiple projects?"**

"I use a combination of urgency/importance assessment and clear communication. At Tanbii, I managed community events, content calendar, moderation issues, and hiring support simultaneously. I'd assess which items had hard deadlines, which had the biggest impact, and which could be batched together efficiently. I also kept stakeholders informed about timelines so there were no surprises. When conflicts arose, I'd communicate proactively about trade-offs and get input on priorities."

### Red Flags to Address Proactively

**Limited Production Experience:**
Frame as honest positioning - operational and community focus rather than hands-on production. Emphasize what you *do* bring and express eagerness to learn campaign delivery.

**Recent Graduation:**
Counter with practical experience (internships, community management) and ongoing education. Show you're actively investing in professional development.

**Healthcare Background:**
Position as transferable skills - data analysis, stakeholder communication, compliance, high-pressure environments. Show you understand the transition to gaming marketing and why you're making it.
