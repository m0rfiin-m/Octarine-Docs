## What Each File Needs

For each file above:
1. Delete the old filename
2. Create new file with "Lesson XX -" prefix
3. Add proper header:
   ```markdown
   # [Title]
   
   **Date:** [Month Day, 2025]  
   **Course:** PY101 - Introduction to Python  
   **Week:** 1, Lesson [X]
   ```
4. Keep all existing content below the header

## Quick Action Plan for Next Session

When Marco says "finish the PY101 renaming":

1. Read each file's current content
2. Delete old file
3. Create new file with proper "Lesson XX -" naming
4. Add proper header with date and lesson number
5. Paste existing content below header

This preserves all the work already done while ensuring consistent naming.
