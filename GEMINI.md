# GEMINI.md

This file provides an overview of the "Octarine-Docs" repository for the Gemini AI assistant.

## Directory Overview

This repository is a personal knowledge base and digital garden belonging to Marco Morfin. It is managed using the Octarine/Obsidian note-taking systems. The content is primarily in Markdown format and covers a wide range of topics including AI, software engineering, career development, personal growth, and technical documentation.

The repository is structured to be a "second brain," holding detailed notes, learning materials, and personal documents. It is also designed to provide context to AI assistants like Gemini and Claude.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following key directories:

*   **`AAS in AI Software Engineering/`**: Contains academic coursework, specifically for a Python 101 course.
*   **`AI-Agents/`**: Holds detailed prompts and configurations for various AI agents (e.g., `Coding-Agent.md`).
*   **`Career/`**: Stores professional documents such as resumes.
*   **`Claude Memory Bank/`**: A collection of documents intended to provide long-term memory and context for AI assistants. It includes technical notes, writing style guides, and more.
*   **`How To's/`**: A series of step-by-step guides and tutorials on various technical topics.
*   **`Telos/`**: Contains documents related to goal-setting and personal planning, using the "TELOS" method.
*   **`Web-Development/`**: A collection of notes and learning materials related to web development, including HTML fundamentals and labs.
*   **`.templates/`**: Contains templates for new notes, such as daily standups.

## Key Files

*   **`CLAUDE.md`**: This file serves as a detailed guide for the Claude AI assistant, explaining the repository's structure, purpose, and conventions. It is a valuable source of information for understanding the project.
*   **`Claude Memory Bank/Index.md`**: An index for the "Claude Memory Bank" directory, providing a quick navigation to key documents.
*   **`AI-Agents/Coding-Agent.md`**: A detailed prompt for an AI coding assistant, emphasizing a verification-first approach to software development.
*   **Educational Notes**: The repository contains numerous educational notes, such as those in `AAS in AI Software Engineering/PY101/` and `Web-Development/HTML Fundamentals/`. These notes are typically well-structured and detailed.

## Usage and Conventions

*   **Format**: The content is almost entirely in Markdown (`.md`).
*   **Syncing**: The repository is automatically synced using the Obsidian Git plugin, which handles commits and pushes. Manual Git operations are rare.
*   **Naming**: Files often have spaces in their names. A critical convention is that folder names must not have trailing spaces to ensure compatibility between macOS and Windows.
*   **No Build Process**: As a documentation repository, there are no build, test, or deployment steps.
*   **AI-Assisted Workflow**: The repository is designed to be used in conjunction with AI assistants. The `CLAUDE.md` file and the `Claude Memory Bank` directory are prime examples of this.

This repository is a living project, continuously updated with new notes, documents, and learning materials.
