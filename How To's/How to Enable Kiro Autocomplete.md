# How to Enable Kiro Autocomplete

Kiro is already installed but autocomplete is disabled by default.

## Step 1: Open Kiro

Launch the Kiro application on your computer.

## Step 2: Enable Autocomplete

Look for the **status bar** at the bottom of the Kiro window.

You should see an autocomplete toggle or setting there. Click to enable it.

## Step 3: Start Using

Once enabled:
- Start typing code
- Ghost text suggestions will appear
- Press **Tab** to accept suggestions

## What Kiro Autocomplete Provides

- **Inline completions** as you type
- **AI-powered suggestions** using Claude
- **Spec-driven development** features
- **Context-aware** code completion

## Alternative: Zed Editor (Free Autocomplete)

If Kiro's autocomplete doesn't meet your needs, consider **Zed editor** which has free built-in autocomplete via Zeta.

### Using Zed:
1. Open Zed
2. Start typing code
3. Ghost text appears automatically
4. Press **Tab** to accept
5. No configuration needed - it just works!

## Comparison of Options

### Kiro
- ✅ Free autocomplete
- ✅ Uses Claude AI
- ✅ Spec-driven development features
- ⚠️ Must be manually enabled

### Zed
- ✅ Free autocomplete (Zeta model)
- ✅ Fast and simple
- ✅ Open-source model
- ✅ Enabled by default
- ✅ Already installed

### VS Code + Codeium
- ✅ Completely free forever
- ✅ Strong inline completions
- ✅ GitHub Copilot alternative
- ⚠️ Requires extension installation

## Recommendation

**Just use Zed!** You already have it, it already has free inline autocomplete via Zeta, and it's exactly the simple, fast editor you wanted. No subscriptions, no complexity.

Try it right now:
1. Open Zed
2. Start typing code
3. Ghost text should appear automatically
4. Press Tab to accept

If Zed's autocomplete isn't good enough, THEN try Kiro's autocomplete or add Codeium to VS Code.
