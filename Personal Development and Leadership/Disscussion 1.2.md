ASSIGNMENT ACTIVITY
## Objectives


Interpret the concepts from the reading in Stretch . 
Demonstrate what "Grit" means through the presentation by Angela Duckworth.
Identify your own Grit and Ambition through self-assessments.

## Rationale

Discussion of ideas and concepts is a key component to growth and understanding. In these weekly discussions,
we will expand on the concepts of the reading and support our peers through providing meaningful feedback on
their posts. The ability to give meaningful feedback is a core tenant of leadership. 


## Grit: Power of Passion & Perseverance (06:09)

Summary: Leaving a high-flying job in consulting, Angela Lee Duckworth took a job teaching math to seventh
graders in a New York public school. She quickly realized that IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful
students from those who struggled. Here, she explains her theory of "grit" as a predictor of success.
