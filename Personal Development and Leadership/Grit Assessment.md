## What Your Score Means

### High Grit (4.0 - 5.0)

You demonstrate strong perseverance and consistency in pursuing long-term goals. You're less likely to be distracted by new interests and more likely to push through challenges. This trait serves you well in demanding fields like entertainment business.

**Strengths:**
- Strong follow-through on commitments

**Strengths:**
- Adaptable to changing circumstances
- Balance between commitment and flexibility

- Incomplete projects
- Difficulty with very long-term goals
- Potential to abandon goals prematurely

### Low Grit (1.0 - 2.4)

## The Two Components of Grit

### Consistency of Interest (Questions 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 11)

Measures how stable your passions are over time. Do you maintain the same interests year after year, or do they shift frequently?

### Perseverance of Effort (Questions 1, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12)

Measures your ability to work hard and overcome obstacles. Do you give up when things get tough, or do you push through?

**Key Insight:** You can be high in one component and lower in the other. Both are important for long-term success.
