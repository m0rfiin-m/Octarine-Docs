## Overview

The 12-Item Grit Scale was developed by Duckworth, A.L., Peterson, C., Matthews, M.D., Kelly, D.R. (2007). Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 9, 1087-1101.

## Instructions

Answer each question honestly, and give yourself the corresponding score for that response. Keep track of your total score. Your individual grit score will be the average of your responses to each question (somewhere between 1 and 5, with 1 being not at all gritty and 5 being extremely gritty).

## Scoring Guide

Add up all your points and divide by 12 to get your grit score. Scores range from 1.00 to 5.00.

Reference scores:
- 12-20 points = 1.00-1.67 (Low grit)
- 21-30 points = 1.75-2.50 (Below average grit)
- 31-40 points = 2.58-3.33 (Average grit)
- 41-50 points = 3.42-4.17 (Above average grit)
- 51-60 points = 4.25-5.00 (High grit)
