## Why Citations Matter

Every time you reference someone else's ideas, research, or words, you must give them credit. This:
- Demonstrates academic integrity
- Allows readers to find your sources
- Strengthens your arguments with credible support
- Protects you from plagiarism accusations

**Remember:** When in doubt, cite it. It's better to over-cite than under-cite.

## Citation with One or Two Authors

When citing sources with one or two authors, include all authors' last names every time you cite.

### Narrative Citation (author as part of sentence)

```
According to Figley (1995), depersonalization and loss of self can occur when serving traumatized individuals.
```

**Pattern:** Author (Year) states that...

### Parenthetical Citation (citation in parentheses)

```
Depersonalization and loss of self can occur when serving traumatized individuals (Figley, 1995).
```

**Pattern:** Statement (Author, Year).

### Two Authors Example

```
Eastwood and Ecklund (2008) explored the concept of secondary traumatic stress, reported that it was later renamed compassion fatigue to provide credence to the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms among helpers who practice with compassion but was exposed to traumatic information through clients.
```

**Pattern:** Author1 and Author2 (Year) found that...

---

## Citation with Three or More Authors

When a source has three or more authors, use "et al." (meaning "and others") after the first author's name.

### Example with Direct Quote

```
The COVID-19 "pandemic contributed to an increase in mental health problems" (Moreno et al., 2020, p. 2).
```

**Pattern:** (First Author et al., Year, p. Page Number)

**Note:** Include page number when using direct quotes.

### Example without Direct Quote

```
Shah et al. (2011) measured spirituality/religiousness and its relation to coping skills among patients with residual schizophrenia.
```

**Pattern:** First Author et al. (Year) found that...

---

## Parenthetical vs. Narrative Citations

### Parenthetical Citations

Used when the citation is **not** part of the sentence structure.

```
Falsely balanced news coverage can be dangerous (see Koehler, 2016, for more detail).
```

**When to Use:**
- Citation feels like an add-on
- Multiple citations in one place
- Emphasizing the information over the author

### Narrative Citations

Used when the author's name is **part** of the sentence.

```
In 2016, Koehler noted the dangers of falsely balanced news coverage.
```

**When to Use:**
- Author is important to your argument
- Introducing a new perspective
- Comparing different researchers' viewpoints

---

## Direct Quotes

When using someone's exact words, you must include a page number (or paragraph number for online sources without pages).

### Short Quotes (fewer than 40 words)

Use quotation marks and include in your paragraph:

```
The researchers found that "pandemic contributed to an increase in mental health problems" (Moreno et al., 2020, p. 2).
```

**Required Elements:**
- Quotation marks
- Author(s)
- Year
- Page number

### Long Quotes (40 words or more)

Create a block quote:

```
Moreno et al. (2020) examined the mental health impact of COVID-19:

      The pandemic contributed to an increase in mental health problems across 
      all demographics. Adverse mental health effects occurred in previously 
      healthy individuals, and new cases of mental health issues emerged among 
      populations that are at high risk. The long-term implications of these 
      trends remain under investigation. (p. 2)
```

**Block Quote Format:**
- No quotation marks
- Indent entire quote 0.5 inches
- Citation after final punctuation
- Double-spaced like rest of paper

## Common Citation Patterns

### Introducing Research

```
According to Greene (2012), mastery requires approximately 10,000 hours of deliberate practice.
```

### Comparing Sources

```
While Figley (1995) focused on depersonalization, Eastwood and Ecklund (2008) examined compassion fatigue specifically.
```

### Supporting Your Point

```
The entertainment industry demands both creative talent and business acumen (Smith, 2018; Johnson, 2020).
```

### Secondary Citations (citing something cited in another work)

```
Classic motivation theory (Maslow, 1943, as cited in Greene, 2012) suggests a hierarchy of needs.
```

**Note:** Only include the secondary source (Greene, 2012) in your reference list.

---

## Special Cases

### No Author

Use the title (or first few words of the title) in place of the author:

```
Box office revenues declined significantly ("Entertainment Industry Report," 2021).
```

### No Date

Use "n.d." (no date) in place of the year:

```
The organization's mission statement (American Film Institute, n.d.) emphasizes...
```

### Organization as Author

```
According to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (2020), diversity initiatives have expanded.
```

First mention: Full organization name  
Subsequent mentions: You can use an abbreviation if established

---

## Multiple Citations in One Statement

### Same Idea, Multiple Sources

List alphabetically and separate with semicolons:

```
Several studies confirm this trend (Johnson, 2019; Martinez, 2020; Smith, 2021).
```

### Multiple Works by Same Author

```
Greene's research (2008, 2012, 2018) consistently shows...
```

## Practice Examples

**Exercise 1:** Identify what's wrong with this citation:

"According to a study, entertainment professionals need business skills."

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Missing: Author and year. Should be something like: "According to Smith (2020), entertainment professionals need business skills."
</details>

**Exercise 2:** Fix this citation:

"Motivation is complex" (2019, Johnson, page 42).

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Should be: "Motivation is complex" (Johnson, 2019, p. 42).

Order is: (Author, Year, p. Page)
</details>

**Exercise 3:** Convert this to a narrative citation:

"Creativity can be systematically developed" (Williams & Chen, 2021).

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>

Williams and Chen (2021) found that creativity can be systematically developed.
</details>
