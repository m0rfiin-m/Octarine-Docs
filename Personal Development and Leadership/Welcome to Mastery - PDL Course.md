If after reading the instructions carefully, and you still have questions, please message me in
the LMS, and in your message, make sure that you state which assignment you are referring to.
In your message, make sure that you specify the problem to allow me to better assist you.
The best method to reach me is through the LMS; however, a Zoom session can be scheduled if
needed.
Note: Messages are generally answered within 24-48 hours.
TIP: This is not a course that you can complete only on the weekends. This is a writing course,
and it takes a lot of time to brainstorm in addition to the time to complete the assignment.
Various Professors for Weekly Lectures
In the Mastery and Personal Development course, we have various Course Directors who
facilitate (teach) the weekly Zoom meetings on various dates and times. Please check the
Meetings tab in the LMS for more details regarding the date and times for each weekly lecture.
Plagiarism
We want to encourage you to practice citing sources with your discussion post and
additional assignments. If you use AI for assistance, make sure to share the link in your
references section or on the references page; otherwise, it is considered academic
plagiarism to use the writing of AI and pass it off as your own.
