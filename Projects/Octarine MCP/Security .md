## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### How to Report

Send an email to: [**security@yourproject.com**](mailto:security@yourproject.com)

Include the following information:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- **Full paths** of source file(s) related to the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)

### Severity Levels

```plaintext
```

| Severity | Response Time | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Critical** | 24-72 hours | Remote code execution, authentication bypass |
| **High** | 1-2 weeks | Local privilege escalation, significant data exposure |
| **Medium** | 2-4 weeks | Limited information disclosure, denial of service |
| **Low** | 4-8 weeks | Minor issues with limited impact |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest stable version
2. **Secure Configuration**: 
   - Use absolute paths for workspace directories
   - Enable read-only mode for sensitive workspaces
   - Set appropriate file size limits
3. **Access Control**: Use filesystem permissions to restrict workspace access
4. **Environment Variables**: Never commit credentials or sensitive paths to version control
5. **Network Isolation**: The server uses stdio only, no network exposure by default

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **Path Traversal Prevention**: Use path validation for all file operations
3. **Error Handling**: Never expose sensitive information in error messages
4. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and monitor for vulnerabilities
5. **Code Review**: All code changes require review before merging

## Known Security Considerations

### File System Access

The server has direct filesystem access within configured workspaces:

- **Mitigation**: Workspaces are isolated and validated
- **User Action**: Configure workspaces with least privilege principle
- **Limitation**: Server runs with the same permissions as the user

### Path Traversal

Potential for path traversal attacks if paths are not properly validated:

- **Mitigation**: All paths are validated and sanitized
- **Detection**: Attempts are logged
- **Prevention**: Use only the provided API, never construct paths manually

### Resource Exhaustion

Large files or searches could consume excessive resources:

- **Mitigation**: File size limits enforced
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for all operations
- **Configuration**: Adjustable limits per workspace

### Workspace Isolation

Workspaces must be properly isolated to prevent cross-workspace access:

- **Implementation**: Path resolution validates workspace boundaries
- **Verification**: Unit tests verify isolation
- **Monitoring**: Suspicious access attempts are logged

## Security Features

### 1. Path Validation

All file paths are validated before any operation:

typescript

```typescript
function validatePath(path: string): void {
  // No null bytes
  if (path.includes('\0')) throw new Error('Invalid path');
  
  // No path traversal
  if (path.includes('..')) throw new Error('Path traversal detected');
  
  // No absolute paths
  if (isAbsolute(path)) throw new Error('Absolute paths not allowed');
}
```

### 2. Workspace Sandboxing

Operations are restricted to workspace boundaries:

typescript

```typescript
function resolveInWorkspace(workspace: string, path: string): string {
  const resolved = resolve(workspace, path);
  if (!resolved.startsWith(workspace)) {
    throw new Error('Path outside workspace');
  }
  return resolved;
}
```

### 3. File Size Limits

Configurable limits prevent resource exhaustion:

typescript

```typescript
const MAX_FILE_SIZE = process.env.OCTARINE_MAX_FILE_SIZE || 10485760; // 10MB
```

### 4. Read-Only Mode

Workspaces can be marked read-only:

json

```json
{
  "workspaces": {
    "Archive": {
      "path": "/path/to/archive",
      "readOnly": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 5. Rate Limiting

Built-in rate limiting prevents abuse:

- Read: 1000 requests/minute
- Write: 100 requests/minute
- Search: 50 requests/minute
- List: 500 requests/minute

### 6. Input Sanitization

All inputs are sanitized before processing:

typescript

```typescript
function sanitizeContent(content: string): string {
  return Buffer.from(content, 'utf-8').toString('utf-8');
}
```

## Audit Log

The server maintains audit logs for security-relevant events:

- Workspace access attempts
- Permission denials
- Path traversal attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Configuration changes

Logs are written to:

- macOS: `~/Library/Logs/Octarine/`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/Octarine/logs/`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\Octarine\logs`

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure
