## DOCUMENT PURPOSE

This document captures the TELOS method for articulating personal context. The goal is to create a clear, traceable path from the problems you want to solve to the daily projects you work on.

The conceptual path is: `Problems -> Mission -> (Narratives) -> Goals -> Challenges -> Strategies â€”> Projects -> Journal`.
