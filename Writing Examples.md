## Introduction 

Hello my name is Marco Morfin I currently live in Los Angeles California. The program that I am currently studying for is a Master's in Entertainment Business here at FullSail. One thing i aspire to accomplish once I am complete with my program at FullSail is working with a big media company like Netflix, Sony or Riot Games. I recently completed my Bachelors degree in Esports Management, Production and Performance from Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. So I want to stay as close to the gaming or entertainment sector as much as possible. 

## Reflection 

Based on my Grit results I scored a 3.75 which is moderate to high levels of perseverance. After reviewing the Grit results I learned that I have the ability to maintain commitment despite setbacks. 
Although I do not see my self as ambitious or gritty there was areas where I scored high showing I was a hard worker and that I demonstrated the level of perseverance required for mastery. This demonstrated that I had the necessity of utilizing Grit. "Grit is the perseverance and commitment (passion) for long-term goals"(Mistick et al.) Even when faced with a lot of obstacles my core perseverance will continue my effort towards my ultimate goal.  
I also carried a strong determination in Resilience. Resilience is being able to adapt and recover quickly from difficulties. Most resilient people do not get stuck in grief, but rather "accept hard times... and look for ways to make the best of a situation" 

As my Ambition score was in between 3.0 meaning not to high but not to low. I learned that for me Ambition is measured by the success achieved through hard work and dedication. In the reading it states that "Success has been redefined as less about accumulating status and more about finding meaning in our careers" (Mistick et al.). That passage resonates with me as I have changed many times different job throughout my life one thing was in common for me. I did not feel successful unless I understood the meaning as to why. Each job had similar aspects in career choice but none satisfied me to say hey I want a long lasting career here.
