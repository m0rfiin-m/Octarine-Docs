## Introduction

Hello, my name is Marco Morfin I currently live in Los Angeles California. The program that I am currently studying for is a Master's in Entertainment Business here at FullSail. One thing i aspire to accomplish once I am complete with my program at FullSail is working with a big media company like Netflix, Sony or Riot Games. I recently completed my Bachelors degree in Esports Management, Production and Performance from Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. So I want to stay as close to the gaming or entertainment sector as much as possible.

## Reflection

Based on my Grit results, I scored a 3.75 which is moderate to high levels of perseverance. After reviewing the Grit results I learned that I can maintain commitment despite setbacks.

Although I do not see myself as ambitious or gritty, there was areas where I scored high, showing I was a hard worker and that I demonstrated the level of perseverance required for mastery. This demonstrated that I had the necessity of utilizing Grit. "Grit is the perseverance and commitment (passion) for long-term goals"(Mistick et al.) Even when faced with a lot of obstacles, my core perseverance will continue my effort towards my ultimate goal.
I also carried a strong determination in Resilience. Resilience is being able to adapt and recover quickly from difficulties. Most resilient people do not get stuck in grief, but rather "accept hard times... and look for ways to make the best of a situation" (Mistick et al.).

Where I can work more on myself is building a resilience against distractions. When facing setbacks, highly resilient people "accept hard times with a steady hand" and focus on what they can learn from the experience, rather than feeling shame or blame (Mistick et al.). I need to develop mental fortitude to maintain focus and ensure I learn from false starts.

The reading shows how Growth vs Fixed Mindset deal with failure. The recommended approach is to follow the Growth Mindset.
Fixed Mindset is believing that abilities are fixed traits while Growth Mindset shows that failure is seen as an encouragement to seek advice or different things to overcome and move forward.

My ambition score was a 3.00. I currently have the foundation for pursing challenges and goals but can work on following a Growth Mindset. (Mistick et aI.) In order to be ambitious it is important to reject the fixed mindset. The belief that ambitions are static in favor of growth, where setbacks are valuable feedback rather than personal shortcomings. By viewing failure as an invitation to seek advice and try new strategies, you can further elevate your Ambition and ensure continued development toward long-term mastery (Mistick et al.).

Finding Meaning in the work is a redefinition of success as looking for meaning in the work rather than just attaining status spoke with both my Grit and Ambition scores (Mistick et al.). By connecting day to day efforts to a bigger purpose, I will remain engaged and resilient, especially during hard or overwhelming periods within my time. As they both align with within my values and work ethic it is crucial to maintaining high Grit and nurturing greater Ambition. Ultimately supporting sustainable achievements and fulfillment throughout my career journey (Mistick et al.)..
