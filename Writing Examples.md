## Introduction 

Hello my name is Marco Morfin I currently live in Los Angeles California. The program that I am currently studying for is a Master's in Entertainment Business here at FullSail. One thing i aspire to accomplish once I am complete with my program at FullSail is working with a big media company like Netflix, Sony or Riot Games. I recently completed my Bachelors degree in Esports Management, Production and Performance from Harrisburg University of Science and Technology. So I want to stay as close to the gaming or entertainment sector as much as possible. 

## Reflection 

Based on my Grit results I scored a 3.75 which is moderate to high levels of perseverance. After reviewing the Grit results I learned that I have the ability to maintain commitment despite setbacks. 
As for the Ambition scale I scored a 3.0 which is right int he middle. I am not too ambitious but just enough to complete a goal.  Although I do not see my self as ambitious or gritty there was areas where I scored high
